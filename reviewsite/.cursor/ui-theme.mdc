ReviewSite: UI/Theme Guidelines (90s-Inspired)
Color Palette
This palette is based on the "90s-inspired" concept, featuring a high-contrast dark theme with a bold red primary accent.

Base Colors
Primary Background: #1A1A1B (Near-black)
Secondary Background: #27272A (Dark gray for cards/modals)
Primary Text: #FFFFFF (Pure white)
Secondary Text: #A1A1AA (Muted gray)
Accent Colors
Primary Accent: #E53E3E (Bold Red)
Secondary Accent (Highlight): #2563EB (Vibrant Blue for focus/active states)
Success: #4CAF50 (Green)
Warning: #FFC107 (Yellow)
Error: #E53E3E (Uses the Primary Accent Red for consistency)
Borders
Standard: #3F3F46 (A slightly lighter gray than the secondary background)
Highlight: #2563EB (Matches the secondary accent color)
Typography
To capture the "modern layout, retro colors" feel, we'll pair a clean, modern font for body text with a mono-spaced, tech-inspired font for headings. Both are available from Google Fonts.

Fonts
Primary (Headings): Share Tech Mono
Regular (400)
Secondary (Body Text): Inter
Regular (400)
Semi-bold (600)
Bold (700)
Body size font in all areas should be a minimum of 16px.

Here are the base Tailwind CSS classes for key components, using our new color palette.

... (We can continue defining other form elements as needed).
Action Bar
Your x-action-bar component is an excellent idea and we will implement it. We'll adapt the hover colors to fit the new theme:

edit: Pencil icon, blue hover (hover:bg-blue-500/30).
view: Book icon, gray hover (hover:bg-gray-500/30).
remove / delete: Trash icon, red hover (hover:bg-red-500/30).

add: Plus icon, green hover (hover:bg-green-500/30).
